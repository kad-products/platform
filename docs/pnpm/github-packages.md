# GitHub Packages

GitHub Packages requires authentication to install packages, even public ones. This guide covers how to configure pnpm to install `@kad-products` scoped packages.

## Project `.npmrc`

Commit this to the root of the repo. It scopes the `@kad-products` registry to GitHub Packages. 

```
@kad-products:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

All other packages continue to resolve from the default npm registry.  And then run this command to tell `pnpm` where the token is stored.  Using variable expansion in `.npmrc` is not supported by `pnpm`.

```sh
pnpm config set //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken "$NODE_AUTH_TOKEN"
```

## Local development

Create a GitHub personal access token with the `read:packages` scope (**Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)**), then export it from your shell profile:

```sh
export NODE_AUTH_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN
```

`pnpm install` will pick it up automatically via the committed `.npmrc`.

## CI setup for consuming repos

`GITHUB_TOKEN` in every workflow run already has implicit `read:packages` access for packages within the `kad-products` org. Adding `registry-url` to the `actions/setup-node` step causes the action to set `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` from `GITHUB_TOKEN` automatically — no PAT or secret changes needed:

```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-node@v7
  with:
    node-version-file: '.nvmrc'
    cache: 'pnpm'
    registry-url: 'https://npm.pkg.github.com'
```

This will need to be added to the shared `create-release.yaml` workflow when a consuming repo first adds an `@kad-products` dependency.
