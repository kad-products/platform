# Husky

[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) manages git hooks. Hooks are defined as executable shell scripts in `.husky/` and initialized via the `prepare` lifecycle script (`"prepare": "husky"`), which runs automatically on `pnpm install`.

## Hooks

### `commit-msg`

Runs commitlint against the commit message to enforce Conventional Commits format.

```sh
npx --no -- commitlint --edit $1
```

The `--no` flag prevents npx from downloading commitlint if it is not installed — commitlint must be present as a devDependency.

### `pre-commit`

Runs lint-staged to auto-fix and format staged files before they are committed.

```sh
pnpm staged:lint
```

### `pre-push`

Runs the full lint and test suite before pushing. Fails fast if checks don't pass, preventing broken code from reaching the remote.

For repos with Git LFS:
```sh
git lfs push origin HEAD
pnpm ci:lint
pnpm ci:tests
```

For repos without tests (e.g. the platform repo):
```sh
pnpm ci:lint
```

### `post-checkout` and `post-merge`

Automatically installs dependencies and switches Node versions after a branch checkout or merge, keeping the local environment in sync without manual intervention.

```sh
export NVM_DIR="${NVM_DIR:-$HOME/.nvm}"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" && nvm install && nvm use
pnpm install
```

## CI behavior

Husky hooks must not run in CI. The shared release workflow sets `HUSKY: 0` in the environment for the semantic-release step to prevent hooks from interfering with the automated release commit. Non-release CI workflows don't trigger hooks because they don't make git commits.
