# Semantic Release & Commitlint

## Commit message conventions

All commits must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types that trigger releases:**

| Type | Release | Changelog section |
|---|---|---|
| `feat` | minor | Features |
| `fix` | patch | Bug Fixes |
| `perf` | patch | Performance Improvements |
| `revert` | patch | Reverts |
| `refactor` | patch | Code Refactoring |
| `BREAKING CHANGE` | major | — |

Types like `chore`, `docs`, `ci`, `test`, and `style` do not trigger a release.

Commitlint enforces this format at commit time via the `commit-msg` husky hook. The config is minimal — extend `@commitlint/config-conventional`:

```js
// commitlint.config.js
export default { extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional'] };
```

## Release config pattern

`release.config.js` exports different configurations for dry-run and CI contexts, detected by checking for `--dry-run` in `process.argv`.

**Dry-run config** (used on PRs via `create-release-dry-run` workflow):
- Sets `repositoryUrl` to the local git directory so semantic-release can analyze commits without network access
- Sets `branches` to the current branch so it works on PRs (which check out detached merge commits, not `main`)
- Runs only analysis plugins — no writes

**CI config** (used on push to main via `create-release` workflow):
- Sets `repositoryUrl` to the GitHub HTTPS URL
- Runs the full plugin chain: analyze → generate notes → update changelog → bump package.json → commit → create GitHub release

**Plugin chain:**

```js
plugins: [
  ['@semantic-release/commit-analyzer', { /* conventionalcommits preset */ }],
  ['@semantic-release/release-notes-generator', { /* conventionalcommits preset */ }],
  '@semantic-release/changelog',
  '@semantic-release/npm',        // bumps package.json version; skips publish if private: true
  ['@semantic-release/git', {
    assets: ['package.json', 'CHANGELOG.md'],
    message: 'chore(release): ${nextRelease.version}\n\n${nextRelease.notes}',
  }],
  '@semantic-release/github',     // creates GitHub release with changelog as body
]
```

`@semantic-release/npm` is always included even for private packages — it handles the `package.json` version bump. Publishing is skipped automatically when `"private": true` is set.

## Token requirements

The release workflow uses `KAD_WORKFLOW_AUTOMATION` (a PAT with repo and workflow scopes) rather than `GITHUB_TOKEN`. This is required for two reasons:

1. The release commit must bypass branch protection rules, which the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot do
2. The release commit must trigger downstream workflows (e.g. publish), which pushes from `GITHUB_TOKEN` do not

See the [create-release workflow docs](../workflows/semantic-release.md) for the full branch protection handling.
