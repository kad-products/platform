# Testing

## `ci:tests` convention

Every repo defines a `ci:tests` script that runs its full test suite. This is the contract that the shared `run-tests` workflow calls — the workflow doesn't know or care what testing tools are used, it just runs `pnpm ci:tests`.

A repo with only Playwright component tests might have:
```json
"ci:tests": "pnpm playwright:run"
```

A repo with multiple test types chains them:
```json
"ci:tests": "pnpm test:unit && pnpm playwright:run && pnpm playwright:e2e"
```

## Playwright

[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) is used for component and end-to-end tests.

**Scripts:**
- `playwright:run` — run all tests headlessly
- `playwright:ui` — open the Playwright UI for interactive debugging
- `playwright:update` — update snapshots (`--update-snapshots`)

**CI environment:** tests run inside the official Playwright Docker container (`mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:<version>-noble`). The container version must match the `@playwright/test` version installed in the repo. Git LFS is initialized before checkout so LFS-tracked assets (screenshots, fixtures) are available.

**Pre-push:** `pnpm ci:tests` runs as part of the pre-push hook in repos with tests, ensuring tests pass before code reaches the remote.

## Vitest

[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) is used for unit and component tests in repos that need fast, in-process test execution. It integrates with Vite and can run alongside Playwright.

Vitest tests run within the same `ci:tests` script as Playwright — there is no separate CI workflow or script namespace for unit vs integration tests.

## TypeScript type checking

`types:check` runs `tsc --noEmit` as a standalone check. It is included in `ci:lint` (not `ci:tests`) since it is a static analysis step with no runtime behavior.
