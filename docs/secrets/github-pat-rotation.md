# KAD_GITHUB_TOKEN rotation

`KAD_GITHUB_TOKEN` is a fine-grained GitHub PAT stored as an org secret. It is used by OpenTofu workflows to manage GitHub org resources — creating repositories, configuring branch and tag rulesets, adding environments, and granting repos access to org secrets.

There is no automated rotation. This is a manual process until the GitHub App migration planned in [#61](https://github.com/kad-products/platform/issues/61).

## When to rotate

- Before the token's expiry date
- Any time the token may have been exposed

## Creating a new token

1. Go to [**GitHub Settings → Developer Settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained tokens → Generate new token**](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens)
2. Set the name to `kad-github-token`
3. Set the expiry to 60 days
4. Set **Resource owner** to `kad-products`
5. Set **Repository access** to **All repositories** (required because the token is used to create new repos)
6. Grant the following permissions:

   **Repository permissions**

   | Permission     | Level          |
   | -------------- | -------------- |
   | Administration | Read and Write |

   **Organization permissions**

   | Permission | Level          |
   | ---------- | -------------- |
   | Members    | Read           |
   | Secrets    | Read and Write |

7. Generate and copy the token value

> If the `kad-products` org requires admin approval for fine-grained PATs, submit the token and approve it from the org settings before proceeding.

## Rolling an existing token

1. Go to [**GitHub Settings → Developer Settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained tokens → Generate new token**](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens)
2. Click the existing `kad-github-token` token in the list (if it does not exist see above for process to create a new token)
3. Generate and copy the token value

## Updating the org secret

1. Go to [**GitHub → kad-products org → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**](https://github.com/organizations/kad-products/settings/secrets/actions/KAD_GITHUB_TOKEN)
2. Find `KAD_GITHUB_TOKEN` and click **Update**
3. Paste the new token value and save
