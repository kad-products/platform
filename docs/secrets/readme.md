# Secrets

Naming and usage conventions for GitHub Actions secrets across the KAD Products organization.

## Naming convention

All org-level secrets use the `KAD_` prefix. Secret names describe **what the credential is**, not how it is used. The consuming workflow maps the secret to whatever name the tool expects.

For example, Wrangler reads `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` from the environment. The org secret is named `KAD_CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN` — it describes the credential. The workflow sets `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.KAD_CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN }}` to satisfy Wrangler's convention. If the deploy tooling changes, only the mapping in the workflow changes — the secret name stays stable.

## Org secrets

| Secret                      | What it is                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `KAD_CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN`      | Cloudflare account token for deploying workers and managing Cloudflare infrastructure                                       |
| `KAD_CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | Cloudflare account ID that all resources are provisioned into                                                               |
| `KAD_CF_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`   | Cloudflare token ID, formatted as an S3 access key for authenticating to the remote state R2 bucket                         |
| `KAD_CF_R2_SECRET_KEY`      | `sha256` of the Cloudflare token value, formatted as an S3 secret key for the remote state R2 bucket                        |
| `KAD_GITHUB_TOKEN`          | Fine-grained GitHub PAT for managing GitHub org resources via OpenTofu — see [rotation procedure](./github-pat-rotation.md) |

The Cloudflare secrets are provisioned by `open-tofu/initial-resources`. `KAD_GITHUB_TOKEN` is rotated manually.
