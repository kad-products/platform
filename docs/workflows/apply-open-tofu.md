# Apply OpenTofu

Runs `tofu init`, `tofu plan`, and `tofu apply` against the calling repo's OpenTofu configuration, using KAD Product's shared Cloudflare R2 bucket as the remote backend for state storage.

The plan is saved and passed directly to apply, so the apply step executes exactly what was planned. This also sets up a clean split point for adding an approval gate between plan and apply in the future — that would require splitting this into two jobs with artifact upload/download, but no changes to the caller workflow.

The backend configuration is fully managed by the workflow — calling repos do not declare a backend block.

## Usage

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-infrastructure.yaml
name: Deploy Infrastructure

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy-github-config:
    uses: kad-products/platform/.github/workflows/apply-open-tofu.yaml@main
    with:
      app_name: my-app
      state_type: github-config
      state_name: setup
      working_directory: infrastructure/github
    secrets: inherit

  deploy-production:
    uses: kad-products/platform/.github/workflows/apply-open-tofu.yaml@main
    with:
      app_name: my-app
      state_type: app-deployment
      state_name: production
      working_directory: infrastructure/environments/production
    secrets: inherit
```

State is stored at `<app_name>/<state_type>/<state_name>/terraform.tfstate`. `state_name` is also used as the GitHub Actions environment for the job — if the named environment doesn't exist it will be created automatically with no protection rules.

The workflow reads the following organization secrets directly — callers do not need to map them:

| Secret | Provisioned by |
|---|---|
| `TOFU_BACKEND_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | `open-tofu/state-storage` module |
| `TOFU_BACKEND_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | `open-tofu/state-storage` module |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | Set manually as an org secret |

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `app_name` | Yes | Application name — first segment of the state key |
| `state_type` | Yes | State category — second segment of the state key (e.g. `github-config`, `app-deployment`) |
| `state_name` | Yes | Instance within the category — third segment of the state key and the GitHub Actions environment (e.g. `setup`, `production`) |
| `working_directory` | Yes | Path to the OpenTofu root configuration within the calling repo |
