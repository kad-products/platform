# Lint Commits

Validates that all commits in a pull request follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format using [commitlint](https://commitlint.io/). Runs only when triggered by a `pull_request` event — if called from a different trigger the lint step is skipped.

The consuming repo is responsible for providing a commitlint config (e.g. `commitlint.config.js`) and having `commitlint` available as a dev dependency.

## Usage

```yaml
# .github/workflows/lint-commits.yaml
name: Lint Commits

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  lint-commits:
    uses: kad-products/platform/.github/workflows/lint-commits.yaml@main
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: read
    secrets: inherit
```

## Required permissions

- `contents: read`
- `packages: read`
