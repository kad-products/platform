# Verify Changes Workflows

Reusable workflows intended to be composed together in a `verify-changes` caller workflow in consuming repos. Using consistent job names (`lint-code` and `run-tests`) enables org-level branch protection rulesets to require both checks universally without per-repo configuration.

## `lint-code.yaml`

Runs the repo's lint, format, and type checks via the `ci:lint` script. The consuming repo is responsible for defining what `ci:lint` covers — typically a combination of Biome, Knip, Prettier, and TypeScript type checking.

```yaml
lint-code:
  uses: kad-products/platform/.github/workflows/lint-code.yaml@main
  permissions:
    contents: read
    packages: read
  secrets: inherit
```

## `run-tests.yaml`

Runs the repo's full test suite via the `ci:tests` script inside the official Playwright container. Using the Playwright container as the universal baseline means repos with only unit tests run in a slightly heavier environment, but all repos use the same setup — avoiding a two-tier system that would produce inconsistent check names.

Initializes Git LFS before checkout and sets `HOME: /root` to ensure Playwright can locate its browser installations inside the container.

The consuming repo defines what `ci:tests` runs — it may be unit tests only, Playwright component tests only, or any combination.

```yaml
run-tests:
  uses: kad-products/platform/.github/workflows/run-tests.yaml@main
  permissions:
    contents: read
    packages: read
  secrets: inherit
```

## `plan-open-tofu.yaml`

Runs `tofu init` and `tofu plan` for a single OpenTofu configuration and posts the output as a PR comment. Add one job per configuration directory the repo manages. Unlike `lint-code` and `run-tests`, plan job names are not required to be consistent across repos — branch protection rulesets don't target them.

When triggered by a pull request, posts the plan output as a comment on the PR. If a comment for the same `state_name` already exists (e.g. from a previous commit on the branch), it is updated in place rather than creating a new one.

The backend configuration is fully managed by the workflow — calling repos do not declare a backend block. State is looked up at `<app_name>/<state_type>/<state_name>/terraform.tfstate` — the same key used by [apply-infrastructure.yaml](./apply-infrastructure.md), so plan and apply always operate against the same state.

Plan jobs require `pull-requests: write` (to post the plan comment) rather than `packages: read`.

The workflow reads the following organization secrets directly — callers do not need to map them:

| Secret | Provisioned by |
|---|---|
| `TOFU_BACKEND_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | `open-tofu/state-storage` module |
| `TOFU_BACKEND_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | `open-tofu/state-storage` module |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | Set manually as an org secret |

### Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `app_name` | Yes | Application name — first segment of the state key |
| `state_type` | Yes | State category — second segment of the state key (e.g. `github-config`, `app-deployment`) |
| `state_name` | Yes | Instance within the category — third segment of the state key (e.g. `setup`, `production`) |
| `working_directory` | Yes | Path to the OpenTofu root configuration within the calling repo |

```yaml
plan-github-config:
  uses: kad-products/platform/.github/workflows/plan-open-tofu.yaml@main
  with:
    app_name: my-app
    state_type: github-config
    state_name: setup
    working_directory: infrastructure/github
  permissions:
    contents: read
    pull-requests: write
  secrets: inherit
```

## `test-open-tofu.yaml`

Runs `tofu init` and `tofu test` against a single OpenTofu module directory. Call it once per module — each call is an independent job and runs in parallel.

### Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `working_directory` | Yes | Path to the OpenTofu module to test |

```yaml
test-my-module:
  uses: kad-products/platform/.github/workflows/test-open-tofu.yaml@main
  permissions:
    contents: read
  with:
    working_directory: path/to/module
```

## Required scripts

Each consuming repo must define these in `package.json`:

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ci:lint` | Runs all lint, format, and type checks |
| `ci:tests` | Runs the full test suite |

## Playwright container version

The container is pinned to `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.63.0-noble`. When upgrading Playwright in a consuming repo, update the container version in the platform repo to match.
