# Workflows

Reusable GitHub Actions workflows for use across the KAD Products organization. Consume them with `uses: kad-products/platform/.github/workflows/<name>@main` and `secrets: inherit`.

## Naming conventions

These conventions apply to all workflow files in this repo and to the caller workflows in consuming repos.

### Filenames

Filenames follow the pattern `<verb>-<noun>-<context>.yaml`. The verb describes the action being performed, the noun is what it acts on, and the context (optional) narrows it further — for example `create-release-dry-run.yaml`.

The key principle is that names should describe **what the workflow does, not the tool it uses to do it**. `commitlint.yaml` names a tool. `lint-commits.yaml` names an action. This forces a little more thought — the obvious name is often wrong or misleading. A workflow that runs semantic-release isn't named `semantic-release.yaml`; it's named `create-release.yaml` because creating a GitHub release is what it actually does.

### Workflow `name`

The `name` field is the title-case equivalent of the filename, with hyphens replaced by spaces. A file named `create-release-dry-run.yaml` gets `name: Create Release Dry Run`.

### Job keys

When a workflow contains a single job, the job key matches the filename without the extension (e.g. `create-release`, `create-release-dry-run`). When there are two or more jobs, each key is kebab-case and describes what makes that job distinct within the context of the overall workflow.

Jobs in shared workflows must not have a `name` field. GitHub derives the check run name from the job key — the string used in branch protection `required_checks` rules — and a `name` field overrides it, making the check run name diverge from the job key. This means any change to the display name silently breaks existing branch protection rules. Omitting `name` keeps the check run name stable and equal to the job key.

### Step `id` and `name`

All steps in all shared workflows should have a short name representing the step's purpose. Step IDs are optional and should only be added when a later step needs to reference the outputs of that step. Steps that don't expose outputs should not have an ID.

## Secrets

Org secrets follow the `KAD_` naming convention defined in [docs/secrets/](../secrets/readme.md). Workflow authors are responsible for mapping these to the env var names that consuming tools expect.

Map secrets to tool-expected names in the job or step `env` block:

```yaml
env:
  CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.KAD_CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN }}
  CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID: ${{ secrets.KAD_CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID }}
```

This keeps the secret name stable regardless of which tool consumes it. If a workflow switches deploy tooling, only the env var mapping changes.

Most shared workflows in this repo handle secrets mapping internally. Callers use `secrets: inherit` and do not need to map secrets themselves.
