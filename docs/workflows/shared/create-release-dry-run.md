# create-release-dry-run.yaml

Runs semantic-release in dry-run mode on pull requests to preview the next version and changelog without creating tags, commits, or GitHub releases.

Output is written to the job summary and posted as a comment on the PR. If a comment already exists from a previous commit on the branch, it is updated in place.

Uses `--no-ci` to bypass semantic-release's branch validation — PRs check out a detached merge commit rather than the target branch, which semantic-release would otherwise reject.

## Inputs

None.

## Secrets

Uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` automatically.

## Permissions

| Permission | Level |
|---|---|
| `contents` | `read` |
| `packages` | `read` |
| `pull-requests` | `write` |

## Requirements

- `.nvmrc` for Node version resolution
- A semantic-release config (e.g. `release.config.js`)
