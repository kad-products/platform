# create-release.yaml

Runs semantic-release on pushes to the main branch to create versioned GitHub releases.

Manages branch protection automatically: saves the current rules before the release, disables protection so semantic-release can push the version commit and tag, then restores the original rules whether the release succeeds or fails.

Uses `KAD_WORKFLOW_AUTOMATION` rather than `GITHUB_TOKEN` so the release commit triggers downstream workflows.

Uses a concurrency group (`create-release`) with `cancel-in-progress: false` to prevent concurrent releases.

## Inputs

None.

## Secrets

| Secret | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `KAD_WORKFLOW_AUTOMATION` | PAT with repo and workflow scopes — used to push the release commit/tag, manage branch protection, and ensure the release commit triggers downstream workflows |

## Permissions

| Permission | Level |
|---|---|
| `contents` | `write` |
| `issues` | `write` |
| `pull-requests` | `write` |
| `packages` | `read` |

## Requirements

- `.nvmrc` for Node version resolution
- A semantic-release config (e.g. `release.config.js`)
