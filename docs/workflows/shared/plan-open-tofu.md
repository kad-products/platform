# plan-open-tofu.yaml

Runs `tofu init` and `tofu plan` against a single OpenTofu configuration directory and posts the output as a comment on the PR.

If a comment for the same `state_name` already exists (e.g. from a previous commit on the branch), it is updated in place rather than creating a new one.

The backend configuration is fully managed by the workflow — calling repos do not declare a backend block. State is looked up at `<app_name>/<state_type>/<state_name>/terraform.tfstate` — the same key used by `apply-open-tofu.yaml`, so plan and apply always operate against the same state.

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `app_name` | Yes | Application name — first segment of the state key |
| `state_type` | Yes | State category — second segment of the state key (e.g. `github-config`, `app-deployment`) |
| `state_name` | Yes | Instance within the category — third segment of the state key (e.g. `setup`, `production`) |
| `working_directory` | Yes | Path to the OpenTofu root configuration within the calling repo |

## Secrets

| Secret | Provisioned by |
|---|---|
| `TOFU_BACKEND_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | `open-tofu/state-storage` module |
| `TOFU_BACKEND_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | `open-tofu/state-storage` module |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | Set manually as an org secret |

These are read directly from organization secrets — callers do not need to map them.

## Terraform variables

The workflow automatically exports `KAD_WORKFLOW_AUTOMATION` as `TF_VAR_kad_workflow_automation`, making it available to OpenTofu configurations as an input variable without any caller configuration.

GitHub Actions does not support dynamic secret lookup at runtime — `${{ secrets[variable] }}` is not valid syntax — so any additional secrets needed as Terraform variables must be mapped explicitly. There is no mechanism for this today; see [#34](https://github.com/kad-products/platform/issues/34) for a planned `extra_tf_vars` input.

## Permissions

| Permission | Level |

| `pull-requests` | `write` |

The `pull-requests: write` permission is required to post and update plan comments on the PR.
