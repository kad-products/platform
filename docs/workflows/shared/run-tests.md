# run-tests.yaml

Runs the calling repo's `ci:tests` script via pnpm inside the official Playwright container (`mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.63.0-noble`).

Initializes Git LFS before checkout and sets `HOME: /root` so Playwright can locate its browser installations inside the container.

## Inputs

None.

## Secrets

Uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` automatically for authenticating with GitHub Packages.

## Permissions

| Permission | Level |
|---|---|
| `contents` | `read` |
| `packages` | `read` |

## Requirements

- `.nvmrc` for Node version resolution
- `ci:tests` script defined in `package.json`

## Notes

The container is pinned to `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.63.0-noble`. When upgrading Playwright in a consuming repo, update the container version in this workflow to match.
